# Final_Project_4121_Information_Visualization
This will be a group project working on selected datasets of our choice, and making inferences while analyzing and solving the issue if given. 

Goals: 

  Recommendation System:
    We want to build a simple “if you like this movie, here are similar ones” system. We’ll use features like genre, director, release year, etc., to recommend about 10 movies that match the same vibe. You select a movie, then we show similar suggestions.

  Trends Over Time:
    We’re going to look at how movie trends have changed over the years. Which genres were big in the '90s vs. now? Are certain genres becoming more popular? We also want to see how average ratings shift over time, by decade, by genre, and maybe even by region if that data exists.
