# Final_Project_4121_Information_Visualization
This will be a group project working on a selected dataset of our choice, and making inferences while analyzing or potentially solving the issue if given. 

Goals: 
  Recommendation System (Landon):
    We want to build a simple “if you like this movie, here are similar ones” system. We’ll use features like genre, director, release year, etc., to recommend about 5 movies that match the same vibe. You select a movie, then we show similar suggestions. (clustering visualization)

  Trends Over Time (Maddie):
    We’re going to look at how movie trends have changed over the years. Which genres were big in the '90s vs. now? Are certain genres becoming more popular? We also want to see how average ratings shift over time, by decade, by genre, and maybe even by region if that data exists.

  Predicting Ratings (Ramona):
    We’ll try to predict whether a movie will be rated good, average, or bad based on factors like genre, release year, and possibly director. Then we’ll identify which features matter most, for example, whether sci-fi movies tend to get higher ratings in recent years.
